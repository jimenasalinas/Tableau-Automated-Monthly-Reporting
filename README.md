# Tableau Automated Monthly Reporting
 Automated monthly reporting dashboard examples using Tableau

- Tableau can be a great tool for simplifying monthly reporting processes using the Tableau Server scheduling function can help save a lot of time updating data sources or running reports. This repository includes some report examples that helped me streamline monthly reporting processes. 

# Monthly Operations Project Pipeline


- **Objective**: Provide a single report that allows for an up-to-date aggregate summary of a business' main program targets at different pipeline stages, while allowing individual program managers to drill down individual project cases. 

- **Sheduled Updates**: daily.

**Organization**: 
- The whole report can be filtered at the top to include any combination of program type, business sector, and offering type.  
- The top two charts provide big-picture ongoing monthly and quartely project counts. 
- The "Project Life Cycle" section breaks down processing metrics by pipeline stage. 
- The "Open Projects: Number of Days Open Since Last Status" allows program managers to indentify individual outlier projects that may require following-up with the commercial customer.
- The bottom two charts provide a breakdown of the big-picture counts by project sector.

# Monthly Application Tracker

- **Objective**: Create a standardized tracker that allows executive managers to track aggregate metrics and allows program managers across different teams to get up-to-date insights about their own program.

- **Sheduled Updates**: daily.

**Organization**: 

- The whole dashboard can be filtered at the top to include any combination of programs.
- The top chart includes daily program application counts.
- The following two charts track the number of processed applications by month.
- The "Days to Complete an Application (3-Month Rolling Avg)" provides a rolling average of the days it has taken the company to process an application.
- The "Submitted Last 12 Months: Open Applications by Waiting Time" allows program managers to identify individual applications that may require follow-up.
